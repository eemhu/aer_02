= aer_02 (Azure EventHub to Syslog bridge using Azure Java Function)

// Add a short description of your project. Tell what your project does and what it's used for.

Allows conversion of Azure EventHub events to Syslog messages and sending them to a RELP server.
Additional processing of the events can be performed based on the `resourceId` of the event and an assigned `Plugin`.

== Features

// List your project's features
* Receives events from Azure EventHub using Azure Java Function.
* Converts said events to Syslog format.
* Allows sending said Syslog-formatted messages to a RELP server.
* Allows the usage of a certificate from Azure KeyVault for TLS encryption.
* Provides HTTPTrigger function for Prometheus metrics.
* Implements akv_01 library for additional syslog message processing based on `resourceId` from events received from EventHub.

== Documentation

See the official documentation on https://docs.teragrep.com[docs.teragrep.com].

== Limitations

// If your project has limitations, please list them. Otherwise remove this section.
Currently only a default `Plugin` is included in the project. If other type of additional message processing is required,
a class implementing `Plugin` and `PluginFactory` must be created and added to the configuration file.

== How to [compile/use/implement]

// add instructions how people can start to use your project

=== Compile using Maven

The project can be compiled using Maven. It is recommended to use Java 11.
[source,bash]
----
$ JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk mvn clean package
----
Using the `package` lifecycle ensures that the necessary JSON manifests to run the Azure Functions are generated.

=== Usage in Azure

The project must be deployed as a Function in a Function App. The Function App requires or supports the following Environment variables:


|===
|Environment variable |Description |Default value |Possible values

|EventHubName
|Specifies the EventHub name from which to receive the events. Must be provided.
|N/A
|Any valid EventHub name

|EventHubConnectionString
|Connection string required to communicate with an EventHub in a namespace. Must be provided.
|N/A
|Valid EventHub connection string

|RELP_TLS_MODE
|Specifies which TLS implementation should be used. By default, no encryption is used.
|`none`
|`none`, `keyVault`

|PLUGINS_CONFIG_PATH
|Specifies the plugin configuration file path.
By default, no configuration is loaded and the DefaultPlugin is used for all resourceIds.
|`""`
|valid path, `""`

|RELP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
|Specifies the time to wait before timing out connection in milliseconds.
|2500
|milliseconds (positive integer)

|RELP_TRANSACTION_READ_TIMEOUT
|Time to wait for destination to acknowledge sent data in milliseconds. Low values may cause duplicates.
|1500
|milliseconds (positive integer)

|RELP_TRANSACTION_WRITE_TIMEOUT
|Time to wait for destination to accept data in milliseconds.
|1500
|milliseconds (positive integer)

|RELP_CONNECTION_RETRY_INTERVAL
|Time to wait between reconnection attempts in milliseconds.
|500
|milliseconds (positive integer)

|RELP_CONNECTION_PORT
|RELP connection destination port
|601
|valid destination port

|RELP_CONNECTION_ADDRESS
|RELP connection destination address
|localhost
|valid destination address

|RELP_REBIND_REQUEST_AMOUNT
|Rebinds the RELP connection after this amount of records is sent,
provided that `RELP_REBIND_ENABLED` is set to `true`.
|100000
|valid amount of records

|RELP_REBIND_ENABLED
|Rebinds the RELP connection after `RELP_REBIND_REQUEST_AMOUNT` of records exceeded.
|`true`
|`true`, `false`

|RELP_MAX_IDLE_DURATION
|Reconnects to the RELP server before sending messages if the set duration has passed without sending any messages.
|`PT2M30S`
|`java.time.Duration` String representation (`PTnHnMnS`) If `n=0`, it can be omitted.

|RELP_MAX_IDLE_ENABLED
|Enable reconnections if duration described by `RELP_MAX_IDLE_DURATION` passes without sending any messages.
|false
|`true`, `false`

|RELP_CONNECTION_KEEPALIVE
|Enable sending alive packets to RELP server
|true
|`true`, `false`

|SYSLOG_APPNAME
|Default app name to be used in the resulting syslog messages. May be overridden by a Plugin implementation.
|aer-02
|any string

|SYSLOG_HOSTNAME
|Default hostname to be used in the resulting syslog messages. May be overridden by a Plugin implementation.
|localhost.localdomain
|any string
